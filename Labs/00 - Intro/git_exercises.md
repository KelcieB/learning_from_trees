# Exercise 1

### You will 1) make a copy (fork) of the *learning\_from\_trees* repo on github and 2) clone that repo to your laptop using the github desktop app.


## 1.1. On the web
* Log into your GitHub account
* Go to [github.com/meireles/learning\_from\_trees](github.com/meireles/learning_from_trees)
* Click "Fork" on the top right corner

## 1.2 Then, on your GitHub Desktop app
* Go to the File menu and select to "Clone Repository"
* Find "YOUR\_USERNAME/learning\_from\_trees" and select it (you may have to  hit the refresh button).
* Choose where the repository will be downloaded to on your computer
* Hit clone


# Exercise 2 -- Work in pairs

### Now you will create your own git repo, add a collaborator, and get commiting. 

## 2.1. On GitHub's website

**One Person**

* Creates a new public repository ("new" button on the left corner)
	* Make sure that you select "initialize with README file"
* Goes to "Settings" (cog icon, top menu) and select the collaborators tab.
* Adds the other person as a collaborator

## 2.2 Then, on your GitHub Desktop app

* Both people clone their repo to their desktop (see Exercise 1, part 2)

* Each person adds a separate text file to the repo, **"file1.txt"** and **"file2.txt"**
	* make sure that you add some random text to your file.

* Explore the changes tab (left).
	* What does it say?
	* What happens if you add some more text to your file and save it?

* Now **commit**, i.e. take a snapshot of your project. 
	* at the bottom of the "changes" tab fill out the "summary" text box
	* click "commit to master"

* Now go over to the history tab. Explore it.

* Finally, click on the top middle tab to Sync your repo back to GitHub (could say Fetch, or Push, or Pull)
	* Do you see your work in your GitHub webpage?
	* Do you see your collaborator's file there?
	* Do you see your collaborator's file synced to your local repo?
